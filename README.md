# 100doors
'''
We have 100 doors in a hallway, all initially closed. 
The first time visit every door and check if the door is closed/open
If the door is closed, opens it; if it is open, closes it. 
The second time visit just every 2nd door.
The third time, every 3rd door, 
so on, until visit the 100th door.
The script lists the number of the open doors after we visited all the 100 doors 100 a times.
